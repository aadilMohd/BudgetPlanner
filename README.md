The team’s main goal is to create an efficient website to manage personal budget and expenses. Users can track their expenses, analyse their expenses. We will make sure the website is user friendly and people from any age group can use this website efficiently. We will show graphical representation also which will improve user interaction with the website.


The project aims to solve people’s problem of handling budgets. This project will enable people to easily manage their expenses and monthly budget. The project will use latest technologies and will create a great user experience by which the users from all the age group can use the project

We have used ScrollJS for the calender.
